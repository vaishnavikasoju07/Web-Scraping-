# Web-Scraping-
Web Scraping Using Python

To achieve this task I have used python libraries such as 
'requests' for fetching web data,
'beautifulsoup' for parsing HTML,
'nltk' for natural language processing tasks like tokenization,
stop words removal,
'vaderSentiment' from 'nltk.sentiment' for sentiment analysis.
